## Questions

1. For whom was Tim Berners-Lee working when he came up with the idea for the WWW?

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

1. Describe the main problem he was trying to solve.

Information availability. Information was stuck in people's heads and notebooks, not available in
any organized manner. This was resulting in duplicated efforts, lost efficiency, and great loss of
information when individuals left the organization.

1. What are the two key ideas upon which the WWW is built?

HTTP, the data transfer protocol, and HTML, the data format.

1. Which of these two key ideas does Berners Lee focus more on in his original paper?

HTML (though it wasn't named yet, so he just refers to hypertext and hypermedia).

1. What are two competitors to the WWW described in the 1994 paper?

WAIS from Thinking Machines Corporation and Gopher from the University of Minnesota.

1. List some advantages and disadvantages of these competing systems.

WAIS had powerful search capabilities, but would "parachute" you in without context (hyperlinks).
Gopher had search and a menu system for navigation, but the menu system was not always intuitive,
and certainly less flexible than hyperlinks. All allowed for access to multiple types of media, but
WWW was the most transparent and flexible.

1. Which points from "the future" have come true? Which have not?

Have come true:
- Name service so that we can reference independent of location
- Hypertext editors that make making websites easy
- More sophisticated document types (stylesheets, javascript, HTML5, etc)
- Integration with "live" features like live doc edit and teleconferencing
- Easy setup servers
- Machine readable formats (in some cases)
- Conventions for charging and commercial use

Have not:
- Links from 2- and 3-dimensional images for creative UI (kind of?)

1. How much did the WWW grow from 1993 to 1994?

From 62 to 829 servers.

1. What does it mean for HTTP to be a "stateless" protocol?
1. What is responsive web design?
