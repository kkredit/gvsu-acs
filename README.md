# GVSU Applied Computer Science

## Purpose of this repo

I am a masters student enrolled in GVSU's Applied Computer Science (formerly Computing and Information Systems) program.
This is a repository of projects I have worked on in my classes.

I see this as a reference for my future self as well as a modest coding resume. If you are a current GVSU student, it is
your responsibility to maintain academic honesty.

## Class list

## Why branch `primary`?

Per [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15844905/how-to-stop-google-indexing-my-github-repository) and
GitHub's [robots.txt](https://github.com/robots.txt) file, only the `master` (and now, maybe `main`) branch of repositories
gets indexed by search engines. I moved from `master` to `main` in order for future students to not be able to find my
solutions so easily.
