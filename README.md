# GVSU Computing and Information Systems

## Purpose of this repo

I am a masters student taking GVSU's Computing and Information Systems (CIS) program. This is a
repository of projects I have worked on in my classes.

I see this as a reference for my future self as well as a modest coding resume. If you are a current
GVSU student, it is your responsibility to maintain academic honesty.

## Why branch `main` instead of `master`?

Per
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15844905/how-to-stop-google-indexing-my-github-repository)
and GitHub's [robots.txt](https://github.com/robots.txt) file, only the `master` branch of
repositories gets indexed by search engines. I moved from `master` to `main` in order for future
students to not be able to find my solutions quite so easily.
