## Purpose of this repo
I am a masters student taking GVSU's Computing and Information Systems
program. This is a repository of projects I have worked on in my classes.

I see this as a reference for my future self as well as a modest coding resume.
If you are a current GVSU student, remember to maintain academic honesty.

## Class list
To interpret the numbers:

- CIS 656: Distributed Systems
- CIS 673: Database Design
